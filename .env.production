# Used when building for production (npm run build)
# This file is included in git and copied during Docker build

# Use /api so requests go to: https://yourdomain.com/api/team-seasons
# The reverse proxy forwards /api/* to the backend container
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=/api

# NOTE: Do NOT add trailing slash - the code adds endpoint paths like /team-seasons
# Example: /api + /team-seasons = /api/team-seasons (correct)
# NOT: /api/ + /team-seasons = /api//team-seasons (wrong)
